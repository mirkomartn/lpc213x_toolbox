# lpc213x_toolbox

A small collection of utility functions written for <a href=https://www.keil.com/dd/chip/3734.htm>the NXP LPC2138 board</a> (most if not all should be easy to adapt for the other boards in the lpx213x family). Some of these rely on additional source/header files that I have not included due to me not being the (single) author.
